abstract: Currently, most of the adjoint-based design systems documented in the open literature assume that the
fluid behaves as an ideal gas, are restricted to the optimization of a single row of blades, or are not suited
to impose geometric constraints. In response to these limitations, this paper presents a gradient-based shape
optimization framework for the aerodynamic design of turbomachinery blades operating under non-ideal
thermodynamic conditions. The proposed design system supports the optimization of multiple blade rows and
it integrates a CAD-based parametrization with a RANS flow solver and its discrete adjoint counterpart. The
capabilities of the method were demonstrated by performing the design optimization of a single-stage axial
turbine that employs isobutane (R600a) as working fluid. Notably, the aerodynamic optimization respected
the minimum thickness constraint at the trailing edge of the stator and rotor blades and reduced the entropy
generation within the turbine by 36%, relative to the baseline, which corresponds to a total-to-total isentropic
efficiency increase of about 4 percentage points. The analysis of the flow field revealed that the performance
improvement was achieved due to the reduction of the wake intensity downstream of the blades and the
elimination of a shock-induced separation bubble at the suction side of the stator cascade.
