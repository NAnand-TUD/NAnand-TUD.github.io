abstract: Axial turbine stages for gas generator cycle type rocket engines typically employ highly-loaded supersonic stator vanes. Consequently, the flow pattern downstream of the vanes is characterized by shock waves which induce high-frequency excitation on the subsequent rotor. For this reason, the optimal design of the stator is crucial in the context of development of the next generation of high-performance rocket engines, where reusability is a principal design criterion. A thorough comprehension of the loss mechanisms combined with the adoption of automated optimisation techniques can therefore enable new stator designs that may provide large benefits in terms of overall turbine performance and lifespan.
